# AppDev

This app was done as an exercise to help learn how to develop an app. The goal was to create a simple inventory app to help keep track of items. The audience would be small businesses or individuals trying ot keep track of items.
I implemented 3 main screens, one for login, one for looking at the inventory and one for addign new items. It was a simple ui and aimed at the widest audience possible.
For the code I went with looking for tutorials to implement my vision of the app. This involved creating a recycler view and implementing a database helper class. These are classes that can be used for a wide range of apps.
I did mainly manual tests for each feature and tried to break it with inputs. Once I was no longer able to break it through standard use I considered good.
I definitely had to think outside the box during ht ecoding of the app.
I think the layouts of the pages turned out really well.
